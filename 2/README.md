# task-1
In task 1, I made a variable n, asked for an input and turn it into integer.

the i made if statement and told if the remainder of n/2 is 0(because remainder can only be zero by dividing with 2 - if n is even). then print even, else odd. 

# task-2
In task 2, firstly I made a variable n and assigned it value 0, to get the the first output as 1(0+1), then i made a loop with range, starting from 1 and going till 50. 
and then gave += opperator to n, to add the value of i to n.

Then I printed n outside the for loop to get only the last output.
